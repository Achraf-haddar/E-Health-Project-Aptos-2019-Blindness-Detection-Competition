# E-Health-Project-Aptos-2019-Blindness-Detection-Competition
There are millions of people who suffer from diabetic retinopathy, the main cause of blindness.
The idea of this project was to automate the diagnostic process by detecting blindness before it occurs using artificial intelligence models specifically image classification on retine's images. 
## Description of Data: 
The data is published in kaggle platform. Large set of retina images taken using fundus photography under a variety of imaging conditions. A clinician has rated each image for the severity of diabetic retinopathy on a scale of 0 to 4:
* 0 - No DR
* 1 - Mild
* 2 - Moderate
* 3 - Severe
* 4 - Proliferative
